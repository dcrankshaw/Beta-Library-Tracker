TODO List:


 -Times are not correct right now. I think the auto_add_now
property is adding them at UTC time or something

 -Times are also not displayed in a very user friendly format
right now, we don't need to display the full date

 -The creator's name is not displayed right now, I have no
idea why

 -Probably should figure out a way to delete things from the database
